Menu *Object*
=============

**New..**
   Opens a sub-menu with a list of all supported objects found in the *objects*-folder. This list is automatically populated. When an object is created, it is placed at the center of the current view.
   
**Clone**
   Make a copy of the selected object and place it slightly offset to the original object.
   
**Delete**
   Delete the selected object. There is no confirmation dialog and no UNDO!
   
**Move forward**, **Move backward**
   Move the selected object one step forwards or backwards along the z-axis. This controls which objects are drawn on top of others.
